Installation:

Requires Eigen Headers and GSKNN 
Add these paths to set_env_cpu.sh 
source set_env_cpu.sh
run make
(or if sparse kernels are already built just python setup.py build_ext --inplace)

Then are two setup files:
1.) Form_hash.py 
    This forms a treehash for a give (or generated dataset) using base PYRKNN tree construction.
    In this branch all distance calculations have been removed as they're not necessary for the hash.
    The hash is stored as a global variable
    (This is bad programming practice but it worked for a quick test in pyrknn/kdforest/mpi/tree.py )
2.) Form_simhash.py
    This forms a simhash and orthonormalized one using a dataset generated by form_hash.py 

This is the testing script:
3.) Test_hash_cluster.py 
    This forms the parition index and then searches it for a query subset of the dataset
