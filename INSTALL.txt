At the moment, this can be a hassle to build. I will fix this to use one makefile once the kernels stop changing so often. (and/or I have a chance to learn cmake properly) 

Require a python enviornment with:
numpy, cupy, cython, parla

Code must be run on a node with a GPU in the current build (as I'm not selectively importing cupy in util.py, tree.py, etc...)

0) Run source set_env.sh
1) Run make in every subdirectory of src/prknn/kernels/gpu/impl/chao
2) Run make in src/prknn/kernel/gpu/impl/chao
3) Run make
